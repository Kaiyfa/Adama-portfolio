##Description
Working With html and CSS Challenge: Portfolio,
I created this project to show my skills in developing websites that are responsive when viewed on smaller devices in addition to being fully functional.

This project primarily serves as an example of how effective the CSS grid system can be when used correctly.

##Usage
This following screenshot shows how responsive the website is on different screen size.
